Windmill is an open-source developer platform to build, run, and share production-grade workflows and internal tools from scripts. It features a powerful UI, job scheduling, real-time logs, a collaborative editor with intellisense, and support for Python, TypeScript, Bash, and more.

Windmill is designed for self-hosting and integrates with your infrastructure, making it easy to automate tasks, build custom UIs, and manage workflows securely. This Cloudron package provides a seamless, single-sign-on-enabled deployment of Windmill with PostgreSQL and persistent storage.
